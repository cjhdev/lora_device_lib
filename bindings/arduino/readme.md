# Are you looking for the Arduino library?

It's in [the output folder](output/arduino_ldl).

# What's the rest of this stuff?

The makefile takes care of "packaging" the Arduino library from the
Arduino specific stuff in src and the core implementation in the root
of the repository. 

You can also use it to build the examples if you have arduino-builder
installed. Built examples appear in the built folder.
